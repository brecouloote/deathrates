        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/nvsr69_01-508.pdf"> The National Vitals Statistics Report</a> conducted a study to see whether
        a pregnancy check box on a death certificate would make a difference in maternal mortality rates.
      </p>

      <p style="font-family:verdana">Over the course of 2015 and 2016, researchers discovered that more maternal
        deaths were reported using the checkbox than without the checkbox at a ratio of 3.07. </p>

      <p style="font-family:verdana">The study also showed black women are more likely to die from pregnancy complications
        compared to white and Hispanic women. </p>

      <p style="font-family:verdana">Nicole Jean-Baptiste, doula and co-founder of Bronx (Re) Birth said
        that some of her black pregnant clients fear dying due to negligence of hospital staff. </p>

      <p style="font-family:verdana">“We're seeing that black pregnant women are going into hospital spaces, and they are
        needing to self-advocate, or at least have someone there who can support them
        in doing this [giving birth] right,” said Jean-Baptiste.</p>
